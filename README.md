Hi! This is an unfinished project! I really didn't get time to code after school started (hopefully that'll be able to change very soon).\n
Most of the functionality is finished. There isn't any design (yet! there will be soon!)\n
Please please please excuse me!!

# What
## What is my project?
This is my project, DailyCode! It's a website that displays a prompt periodically (daily-- hence the name-- was the original, but it may be infeasible, so I'm thinking weekly instead).\n
Users can create accounts and then code projects pertaining to that prompt, then upload them on the website where it'll be shown to other users on the homepage.\n
From there, other users can view, comment, and vote on these projects!

# Why
## Why did I make this project?
I made this project because, simply put, I wanted to address a common issue faced by many programmers (including myself!)-- that is, we often can't think of a project to make even if we want to code.\n
I hoped that by making a website where not only can one see a prompt for inspiration, but can also interact with other programmers, I could somewhat help remedy this problem!

# How
## How did I make this project?
I used React + Vite to make this program, along with a MongoDB collection for saving user data, and nodemailer for email notifications/verification. I planned to implement Tailwind, but I wasn't able to reach that stage yet (planning on it!)

# What did I struggle with?
A lot!! This was my first time going in-depth with React-- I had used it before, for other projects, but they were usually smaller projects that weren't as complex as this one.\n
So the biggest struggle for me was getting used to React. I really want to do more with it in the future. Maybe even make apps!\n
Also, setting up nodemailer was kind of difficult as well.
